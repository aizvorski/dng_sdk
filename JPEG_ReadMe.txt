To build the DNG SDK, you also need to download and install the libjpeg package. It is available from:

http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8d.tar.gz

or

http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr8d.zip

Rename the "jpegsrc.v8d" or "jpeg-8d" folder to "libjpeg", and place it next to the dng_sdk folder (i.e. as a sibling of this read-me file).
