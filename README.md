# Adobe DNG SDK

This is a repository to make some minor fixes and add Linux build scripts for the Adobe DNG SDK.  

The original SDK targets Mac/Windows, but getting it to build on Linux requires a few tricks.  

Hat tip to https://gist.github.com/icqparty/be17fbacc7e92f5349c9 for figuring out everything first :)

Dependencies: XMP SDK is required.
