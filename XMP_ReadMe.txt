To build the DNG SDK, you also need to download and install the Adobe XMP SDK. It is available from:

http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/

Rename the "XMP-Toolkit-SDK-<version>" folder to "xmp_sdk", and place it next to the dng_sdk folder (i.e. as a sibling of this read-me file).

Note that the current XMP SDK also requires you to download some additional source code.  See the ReadMe.txt files inside the XMP SDK's third-party folder for details.
