/** \mainpage Adobe Digital Negative SDK 1.4
 *
 * \section Intro Introduction
 *
 *  Digital Negative (DNG) is a non-proprietary file format for camera raw image data and metadata.
 *  A wide variety of cameras and sensor types are supported by DNG, using the same documented file layout.
 *
 *  This SDK provides support for reading and writing DNG files as well as support for converting
 *  DNG data into a displayable or processible image. This SDK is intended to serve as a starting point
 *  for adding DNG support to existing applications that use and manipulate images.
 *
 * \section dng_validate Command line validation: dng_validate
 *
 *  A good place to start investigating the DNG SDK is the dng_validate command line tool,
 *  which can read, validate and convert an existing DNG file. The dng_validate.cpp file
 *  demonstrates a number of common uses of the SDK. 
 *  Documentation for the tool can be found \ref doc_dng_validate "here."
 *
 * \section start Starting points
 *
 *  - dng_host Used to customize memory allocation, to communicate progress updates and test for cancellation.
 *  - dng_negative Main container for metadata and image data in a DNG file.
 *  - dng_image Class used to hold and manipualte image data.
 *  - dng_render Class used to convert DNG RAW data to displayable image data.
 *  - dng_image_writer Class used to write DNG files.
