\section license_faq Frequently Asked Questions

\par Why MIT License?
The MIT License is an existing Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license, and it covers the needs of the Adobe Source Libraries. We feel OSI approval is important and that there was not a need to introduce yet another license; the MIT License is sufficient.

\par Does this license cover all Adobe Open Source efforts?
No. This license only applies to the Adobe Open Source Libraries. Other Open Source efforts (such as XMP) are covered by their own licenses (such as the <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xmp/sdk/license.txt">Adobe Open Source License</a>).

\par
The original Adobe Open Source License as it relates to historical projects once posted at stlab.adobe.com can be found <a href="http://stlab.adobe.com/historical/aoslic.shtml">here</a>. Please note that this license no longer applies to anything currently found on the Adobe Open Source website.
